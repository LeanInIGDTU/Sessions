# Session : Basics of Open Source

### Prerequisites

* Version control system like [Github](https://git-scm.com/downloads), bitbucket were covered.
* Account on Github
* [Git Setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)
* #### Command to configure: 
* $ git configure --global user.name "John"
* $ git configure --global user.email "John@gmail.com"
* [Hosting project on github](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3nIqUVBKKGIbmgzMmU5TkFrNEE/view?usp=sharing)
* First of all: Create account on GitHub: https://github.com/    
Setup/Configure git by opening the command prompt/terminal and running the 1sr command, pressing enter then entering the 2nd command. Steps given in the picture captioned configuring git
Now, to actually host/put up your project/respository on GitHub: 

1. Create the folder you want to put up on GitHub. Go to GitHub, you'll see a plus icon right to the search bar
Click on it, select the create new repository option
Name it something
The URL of this repository will be used in step 8 for "remote repository URL
 
2. Open a text editor:Notepad/Notepad++/SublimeText(my personal favorite)

3. Since it's only for practice, copy some random piece of code from the internet and save it with any extension(like .html, .js, .css) you want in that folder created in st@4. Go to the command prompt/terminal and2 enter the following command: cd /path/of/the/folder/created/in/step1
(Cd stands for change directory, the folder is called directory, also you can simply run cd then drag the folder in the command prompt/terminal. The address gets cooped there(just a simple trick))

5. After the 4the step, follow the steps given in the picture with caption steps to host project

* [Pull request]( https://drive.google.com/file/d/16T-zHCZzUwOZdCErrc1R_QvVwYfrL4eI/view?usp=sharing)
* From 1:29 to 2:27, I'm trying to run my program. In Mac we can use the terminal for both git and compiler so pls don't get confused. You will compile the program the way you do, be it turbo cpp/code blocks or whatever you use.
Also there's a git command called git status 
It tells you about the current status of your repository, whether there are any changes that need to be added, or committed or pushed. 
Use it frequently. It's helpful.
